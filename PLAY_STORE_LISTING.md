🚀 WHY MOBILEDIGGER?

Traditional file managers are slow for organizing music. MobileDigger combines playback with organization - you can sort 100 songs in the time it takes to open a file browser.

Inspired by DJ culture and the art of "crate digging" - finding gems in large music collections.

🎯 USE CASES:

• Pre-listen to new music releases
• Organize downloaded DJ pools
• Sort Beatport/Bandcamp purchases
• Categorize production samples
• Clean up music libraries
• Prepare DJ sets by mood/genre

📱 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

• Android 12 or higher (API 31+)
• 100MB free space
• Recommended: 2GB+ RAM for large libraries

🔄 RECENT UPDATES (v10.46):

• Smart miniplayer - always see what's playing
• Performance profiling for optimization
• Memory monitoring and leak prevention
• Architecture improvements
• Bug fixes and stability improvements
