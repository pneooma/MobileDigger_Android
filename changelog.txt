- Incremented build version to 8.53.

8.54
- Subfolder picker (left of TODO/Liked): added multi-select checkboxes and View button to aggregate selected liked subfolders into the Liked playlist; preserves current playback.

- Performance: Removed time/bitrate lines in lists; skipped background duration extraction; waveform seeking restored.
- Stability: Preparing logcat monitoring for crash investigation.
- Incremented build version to 8.57.

8.58
- Source history buttons now only set source; scanning happens only on Rescan.
- Adjusted rescan label and recent sources UX; crash monitoring improvements.
 - Incremented build version to 8.58.

8.59
- Added smart automatic cache trimming with LRU eviction and safety for in-use files.
- New CacheManager caps cache (preferred 512MB, hard 1GB) and runs periodically.
- Protected active FFmpeg data source and temp WAV paths during cleanup.
- Integrated with periodic maintenance; no interference with playback/workflows.
- Incremented build version to 8.59.
- Incremented build version to 8.58.

8.66
- Optimized Amplituda waveform generation for faster processing.
- Changed compress parameter from 10 to 8 samples/second (25% faster generation).
- Maintained high quality with Compress.AVERAGE algorithm.
- Updated all waveform views: SharedWaveformState, ScrollableWaveformView, AmplitudaWaveformView.
- Incremented build version to 8.66.

8.67
- Major AIFF file optimization for waveform generation.
- AIFF files now use 2 samples/second (vs 8 for other formats) for 4x faster processing.
- AIFF files are uncompressed, so fewer samples still provide excellent quality.
- Added file type detection in all waveform components.
- Enhanced logging to show file type and samples/second used.
- Updated all waveform views: SharedWaveformState, ScrollableWaveformView, AmplitudaWaveformView.
- Incremented build version to 8.67.

8.68
- Maximum AIFF optimization: reduced to 1 sample/second for 8x faster processing.
- AIFF files now use minimal samples for maximum speed while maintaining quality.
- Updated all waveform components with 1 sample/second for AIFF files.
- Enhanced comments to reflect maximum speed optimization.
- Incremented build version to 8.68.

8.69
- AIFF optimization refinement: maintained 1 sample/second for optimal balance.
- Amplituda library requires integer values for samples/second parameter.
- AIFF files continue to use minimal samples for maximum speed while maintaining quality.
- Updated all waveform components with consistent 1 sample/second for AIFF files.
