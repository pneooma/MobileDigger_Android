- 🔄 Auto-skip: Sends broadcast to trigger next() when FFmpeg crashes
- 📊 Evidence: ExoPlayer shows "None of the available extractors could read the stream"
- ✅ AIFF files use FFmpegMediaPlayer but app won't crash - will auto-skip instead
- 🎯 The problem: Neither FFmpegMediaPlayer nor ExoPlayer reliably support AIFF
- 🔧 Solution: Use FFmpegMediaPlayer but gracefully handle crashes with auto-skip

9.85
- 🎵 CRITICAL FIX: Switched AIFF files to ExoPlayer (FFmpeg crashes during playback)
- 🔍 Root cause: FFmpegMediaPlayer crashes during actual playback, not just setup
- ⚡ New approach: Use ExoPlayer for AIFF files instead of FFmpegMediaPlayer
